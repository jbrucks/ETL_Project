# ETL_Project

Our group got together and discussed topics and direction for a project we were interested in. We came to the topic of everyone's favorite fruit, the avocado! With that we thought we'd look into it's recent growing popularity and price increase and see if we could find data and variables that might have driven that price. We took to searching Kaggle,  OpenWeather, USDA, and other sites to find relevant data sets. Once we had at least a start for relevant data, we went about cleaning, shaping, and importing this data into a SQL database. Much of this data being produced at time intervals, we were able to shape and form the data to align based on weeks of the year. We were able to collect roughly three years worth of data between 2015 and 2018 for future analysis.
